#### Evolutionary algorithms ####

This fork of <a href="https://github.com/davidedc/livecodelab/">LiveCodeLab</a> intends to add a *Mutator* interface, for defining 'genes' that can then be bred by the user.
The idea is that it becomes possible to smoothly transition between writing code to explicitly express ideas, and exploring potential variations intuitively and subjectively.
